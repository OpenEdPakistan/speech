# Audio Content Creation using Microsoft Cognitive Services and Speech Studio
## Why?
**Custom Development:** Developers typically write a Windows Forms or Console Application using C# to call the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech API to generate audio utterances for their applications; refer to code in the Samples-Http folder here. [https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Speech-TTS]
## What?
**No Code:** The approach used by OPEN (Open Pakistan Education Network) and illustrated visually below, uses a no-code approach offered by the Speech Studio portal to create audio content for its knowledge content, so that Pakistani learners can get a clear Neural voice and not a robot-sounding voice in their courses.
